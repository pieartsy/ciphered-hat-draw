        <h1>Ciphered Hat Draw</h1>

        <p><i>A lot of virtual tools have a way to draw names or task assignments out of a 'hat'. However, unlike hat picks or randomly assigned slips of paper in real life, these virtual hat draws are only visible to the one person who has the website open. That person also knows what task got picked from the hat and who they're assigning it to. I needed something anonymous but couldn't find anything outside of Secret Santa tools (which I don't <b>think</b> are what I want - or are at the very least more intensive about the process than I need).
        </p>

        <p>Thus, I came up with this. It uses Vigen√®re Cipher enciphering and deciphering in lieu of the more complicated stuff.
        </i></p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>One person in your group (such as the usual hat-picker) should put names and tasks in the Assigner and click the button. Make sure there's an equal amount of names and tasks. The tool doesn't allow duplicates.</p>

        <p>Hat-picker, send the <b>results link</b> to all participants. When a participant types in their name on the results page and clicks the Decipher button, their task assignment will be revealed. (This <i>does</i> mean that anyone, such as the hat-drawer, who knows participants names can find out their assignment...but cheating defeats the point here, doesn't it?)</p>

        <h2>Assigner</h2>
        <textarea class="txtarea" id="names" placeholder="Enter names separated by line"></textarea>
        <textarea class="txtarea" id="tasks" placeholder="Enter tasks separated by line"></textarea>
        <button id="assign">Assign tasks!</button>

        <div id="results"></div>
        
        <script src="name picker.js"></script>
