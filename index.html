            <h1>Ciphered Hat Draw</h1>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>One person in your group (such as the usual name-drawer) should put names and tasks in the hat and click the button. The hat will ignore any duplicates in the lists.</p>
            
            <p>If there are more names than tasks, the hat, by default, will repeat the tasks again to make sure everyone gets a task (so more than one person will have the same task).</p>
            
            <p>If there are more tasks than names, the hat, by default, will continue to distribute the tasks among people (so some people may have more than one task).</p>

            <p>If you toggle the <b>Discard extra tasks</b> option on, everyone will only get one task or less. If there's not enough tasks, only some people will get any assignment; If there's too many, extra tasks will be discarded.</p>

            <p>Name-drawer, send the <b>results link</b> to all participants. When a participant types in their name on the results page and clicks the <b>Get your task!</b> button, their task assignment will be revealed. (This <i>does</i> mean that anyone, such as the name-drawer, who knows participants' names can find out their assignment...but cheating defeats the point here, doesn't it?)</p>

                <p>A lot of virtual tools have a way to draw names or task assignments out of a 'hat'. However, unlike hat draws or randomly assigned slips of paper in real life, these virtual hat draws are only visible to the one person who has the website open on their own browser. That person also knows what task got picked from the hat and who they're assigning it to. I want something that adheres closer to real life hats draws - no one, including the name-drawer, knows what others are getting (unless you cheat I guess).</p>
    
                <p>Thus, I came up with this. It uses Vigen√®re Cipher enciphering and deciphering in lieu of the more complicated stuff.</p>
