        <h1>Ciphered Hat Draw</h1>

        <p>One person in your group (such as the usual hat-picker): Put names and tasks in the Assigner and click the button. Make sure there's an equal amount of names and tasks. The tool doesn't allow duplicates.</p>

        <p>When the results appear, give the <b>Encrypted task</b> text to each person according to their name. This is a Vigen√®re Cipher, and can only be decoded with their name as the key. (This <i>does</i> mean that anyone, such as the hat-drawer, who knows the keys assigned to each encrypted text will be able to decrypt the text as well...but cheating defeats the point here, doesn't it?) On their own device, they should write their name and paste the encrypted task in the appropriate fields and click the Decipher button. This will reveal their task assignment.</p>

        <h2>Assigner</h2>
        <textarea class="txtarea" id="names" placeholder="Enter names separated by line"></textarea>
        <textarea class="txtarea" id="tasks" placeholder="Enter tasks separated by line"></textarea>
        <button id="assign">Assign tasks!</button>

        <div id="results"></div>

        <h2>Decoder</h2>
        <input type="text" id="key" placeholder="Write your name here.">
        <input type="text" id="ciphertext" placeholder="Paste the enciphered text here.">
        <button id="decipher">Decipher your task!</button>
        <textarea class="txtarea" id="decipheredtext" readonly></textarea>
