# Hat Draw
A lot of virtual tools have a way to draw names or task assignments out of a 'hat'. However, unlike hat draws or randomly assigned slips of paper in real life, these virtual hat draws are only visible to the one person who has the website open on their own browser. That person also knows what task got picked from the hat and who they're assigning it to. I wanted something that adheres closer to real life hats draws - no one, including the name-drawer, knows what others are getting (unless you cheat I guess).</p>
    
Thus, I came up with this. It uses Vigen√®re Cipher enciphering and deciphering in lieu of the more complicated stuff. It also encodes into/decodes from base64 to allow for (most of) the [extended ASCII](ascii-code.com/) set.
